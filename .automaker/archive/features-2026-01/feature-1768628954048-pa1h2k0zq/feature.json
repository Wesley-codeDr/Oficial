The parent task was about implementing Apple's Liquid Glass 2026 design system, and looking at the `LIQUID_GLASS_GLOBAL_UPDATE.md` documentation, I can see that there are several components still pending the Liquid Glass upgrade:\n\n---\n\n# Specification: Complete Apple Liquid Glass 2026 Implementation - Remaining Components\n\n## 1. **Problem**\nThe WellWave application has partially implemented the Apple Liquid Glass iOS 26 design system (~70% coverage). Several important components remain without the full Liquid Glass treatment, creating visual inconsistency across the application. Users experience a fragmented UI where some sections look modern (iOS 26 style) while others appear dated.\n\n## 2. **Solution**\nApply the complete Liquid Glass iOS 26 design system (rim-light, inner-glow, noise-grain, glass-pill classes) to all remaining components: Auth forms (login, register, forgot-password), Admin components, and ensure all modals/pages follow the same design language.\n\n## 3. **Acceptance Criteria**\n\n- **GIVEN** a user on the login page, **WHEN** viewing the form, **THEN** all inputs, buttons and error states display with iOS 26 Liquid Glass effects (rim-light, glass materials)\n\n- **GIVEN** a user on the register page, **WHEN** interacting with form fields, **THEN** all elements have consistent glass-pill styling with backdrop-blur and rim-light effects\n\n- **GIVEN** a user on the forgot-password page, **WHEN** viewing the form and success state, **THEN** all UI elements match the Liquid Glass 2026 design system\n\n- **GIVEN** the auth layout, **WHEN** viewing the glass card container, **THEN** it displays with rim-light-ios26 and inner-glow-ios26 pseudo-elements\n\n- **GIVEN** any admin component (ExtractionReview, GlassUploadZone), **WHEN** rendered, **THEN** all buttons use glass-btn-primary or glass-btn-ghost classes, and cards have proper rim-light treatment\n\n## 4. **Files to Modify**\n\n| File | Purpose | Action |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` | Auth layout wrapper | modify |\n| `components/auth/login-form.tsx` | Login form component | modify |\n| `components/auth/register-form.tsx` | Register form component | modify |\n| `components/auth/forgot-password-form.tsx` | Forgot password form | modify |\n| `components/admin/ExtractionReview.tsx` | Admin extraction review | modify |\n| `components/admin/GlassUploadZone.tsx` | Admin file upload zone | modify |\n| `app/liquid-glass-utils.css` | Add new utility classes | modify |\n\n## 5. **Implementation Tasks**\n\n```tasks\n- [ ] T001: Add rim-light-ios26 and inner-glow-ios26 classes to auth layout glass card | File: app/(auth)/layout.tsx\n- [ ] T002: Update login-form.tsx with glass-btn-primary button and glass-pill error states | File: components/auth/login-form.tsx\n- [ ] T003: Update register-form.tsx with glass-btn-primary and glass-pill styling for success state | File: components/auth/register-form.tsx\n- [ ] T004: Update forgot-password-form.tsx with GlassInput and glass button styling | File: components/auth/forgot-password-form.tsx\n- [ ] T005: Add noise-grain class and rim-light treatment to ExtractionReview panels | File: components/admin/ExtractionReview.tsx\n- [ ] T006: Ensure GlassUploadZone has complete iOS 26 glass styling on all states | File: components/admin/GlassUploadZone.tsx\n- [ ] T007: Add glass-btn-ghost utility class to liquid-glass-utils.css | File: app/liquid-glass-utils.css\n```\n\n## 6. **Verification**\n\n1. Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`\n2. Verify all forms display with:\n   - Rim-light effects on glass containers (subtle white glow on borders)\n   - Inner glow effects (specular highlight from top)\n   - Noise texture background (subtle grain)\n   - Buttons with glass-btn-primary gradient\n   - Error states with glass-pill styling\n3. Test dark mode toggle to ensure proper opacity adjustments\n4. Navigate to admin routes and verify ExtractionReview and GlassUploadZone components have consistent styling\n5. Check \"Reduce Transparency\" accessibility setting provides solid fallbacks\n\n---",
