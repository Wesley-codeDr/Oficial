  "description": "Transform Project Layout to Apple Liquid Glass 2026 Design System\n\nRedesign the entire project interface to match Apple's Liquid Glass 2026 design language, implementing the dynamic material system introduced at WWDC 2025 and deployed across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26.\n\nCore Design Principles to Implement:\n\nHIERARCHY\n- Replace solid UI blocks with floating glass layers that sit above content\n- Ensure content always takes visual priority over interface controls\n- Implement translucent controls that visually recede when not in active use\n- Create clear depth separation between navigation, content, and interactive elements\n\nHARMONY\n- Align all UI elements with Apple's rounded geometry standards\n- Design for HDR displays and edge-to-edge screen layouts\n- Match hardware aesthetics (device corners, button radiuses, border treatments)\n- Ensure visual consistency with reference images provided\n\nCONSISTENCY\n- Apply unified design patterns across all project screens and components\n- Use identical control behaviors and navigation patterns throughout\n- Implement shared material physics for all glass elements\n- Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color treatment\n\nTechnical Implementation Requirements:\n\nGLASS MATERIAL SYSTEM\n- Implement translucency with variable opacity (20%-80% based on context)\n- Add real-time GPU rendering for refraction and blur effects\n- Create lensing effects where background content subtly bends through glass layers\n- Add specular highlights that respond to device motion and user interaction\n- Ensure automatic adaptation between Light Mode and Dark Mode\n\nUI COMPONENTS TO REDESIGN\n- Buttons and toggles with glass backing\n- Sliders and controls with translucent treatment\n- Navigation bars and tab bars that collapse/expand on scroll\n- Modal sheets with frosted glass backdrop\n- Widgets with transparent or semi-transparent backgrounds\n- Dock elements with refractive properties\n- Control panels with clear separation from content\n\nLAYOUT CHARACTERISTICS\n- Rounded geometry matching device hardware\n- Selective blur that preserves clarity without flattening depth\n- Layered spatial hierarchy with clear z-axis positioning\n- Motion responsiveness tied to user interactions\n- Text always on solid layers (never directly on glass) for readability\n\nPLATFORM-SPECIFIC FEATURES\n- Transparent/adaptive dock and app icons\n- Frosted control center buttons\n- Optional \"Clear Mode\" with fully transparent UI elements\n- Refractive sidebars that preserve surrounding context\n- Glass-based window chrome and navigation elements\n\nPerformance & Accessibility Considerations:\n\nPERFORMANCE\n- Optimize GPU rendering to avoid battery drain (target <1% impact)\n- Implement fallbacks for older devices with simplified rendering\n- Avoid nested glass layers that increase processing load\n- Limit glass effects in scrollable lists to maintain frame rate\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n- Test against \"Reduce Transparency\" system setting and provide solid fallbacks\n- Respect \"Reduce Motion\" preferences by disabling motion-based effects\n- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios on all backgrounds (WCAG AA minimum)\n- Verify readability across various content types and lighting conditions\n- Test with VoiceOver and other assistive technologies\n\nVISUAL REFERENCES\n- Analyze provided reference images for exact glass opacity levels\n- Match blur intensity, refraction depth, and highlight positioning\n- Replicate layer stacking order and spatial relationships\n- Ensure color tinting matches examples in both light and dark modes\n\nBEST PRACTICE EXAMPLES TO FOLLOW\n- Camera app: Floating minimal controls over full-screen content\n- Photos app: Disappearing navigation that reveals on scroll\n- Safari: Glass address bar with adaptive content-based tinting\n- Music app: Layered controls over album artwork\n- Weather app: Glass buttons over dynamic/animated backgrounds\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Visual parity with Apple's native iOS 26/macOS Tahoe 26 applications\n- Matches reference images provided for layout, spacing, and material treatment\n- Passes accessibility audits with proper fallbacks enabled\n- Maintains 60fps performance during scrolling and transitions\n- Works seamlessly in both light and dark appearance modes\n- All text remains legible on all backgrounds\n- Interactive elements provide clear visual feedback\n- Design feels cohesive, premium, and unmistakably aligned with Apple's 2026 design direction",
